<h1 align="left">🤖 Webots---Maze Solving Robot Simulation</h1>

<h1 align="left">🌟 Introduction</h1>

This project was developed for the **IESL RoboGames 2024** competition, under the **University Category**, organized by the **Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), University of Moratuwa**, in collaboration with the **Institution of Engineers, Sri Lanka (IESL).** The RoboGames is an annual robotics competition designed to inspire innovation, foster knowledge sharing, and showcase cutting-edge solutions in robotics engineering.

<h1 align="left">🎯 Project Objective:</h1>

The primary objective of this project was to design and program an e-puck robot to successfully navigate a customized Webots simulation arena. The task requirements, as specified in the competition guidelines, included:

- **Arena Design**: Building a 2.5m x 2.5m Webots environment following strict specifications for wall dimensions and spacing, with colored walls representing key waypoints.
- **Navigation Task**: Programming the robot to visit walls in the specified color sequence: **Red -> Yellow -> Pink -> Brown -> Green.**
- **Dynamic Starting** Position: Ensuring the robot could complete the task regardless of its initial placement within the arena.
- **Completion Criteria**: The robot must stop after completing the required sequence.
